# 🧠 Q-Learning Maze Game 🕹️

A **Q-learning-based maze-solving game** implemented in Python with **Pygame visualization**.  
The agent learns to navigate through a maze using reinforcement learning (Q-learning) and can be trained to find the optimal path.

## 📌 Features
- 🔍 **Gym-like Environment**: A grid-based maze with obstacles, rewards, and state transitions.
- 🎮 **Pygame-based Visualization**: Renders the maze, agent movement, and allows manual control.
- 🤖 **Q-learning Algorithm**: Uses an **epsilon-greedy strategy** for learning the best path.
- 💾 **Q-table Saving & Loading**: Train once and reuse the learned policy.
- 🔄 **Training & Inference Modes**: Train the agent or manually navigate the maze.
